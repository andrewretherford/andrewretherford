# About Me
A Software Engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.  When Iâ€™m not working I spend my time doing things that I love including gaming, archery, mountain biking, watching anime, or just learning how to do something new!  

As an engineer, I draw great satisfaction from the magic of building something new and seeing it come to life.  I love discovering my own solution to a problem, and enjoy the challenge of finding the best way to implement it.  Working with others who are more skilled than I am inspires me, and I always welcome the learning opportunity that it provides.
